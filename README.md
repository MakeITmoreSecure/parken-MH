This project aims to showcase the bad security on the parken-mh API / endpoints.
Actually this allows me to track my friends & family across the city.

# Track_Me
this can be used to track a single plate 
```shell
python3 code/track_me.py --plate M-AS213
```

a [] means, nothing found, the rest will explain itself :D
